    Your task is to scan a folder, categorize files, compress specific formats, and execute tasks from a `todo.txt` file.

    ### 1. Organizing Files
    - List all files in the given directory.
    - Identify file types and move them into categorized folders such as:
    - `PDFs/` → For `.pdf` files  
    - `Images/` → For `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.  
    - `Documents/` → For `.docx`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, etc.  
    - `Code_Files/` → For `.py`, `.cpp`, `.java`, `.js`, etc.  
    - `Archives/` → For `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, etc.  

    ### 2. File Compression
    - Locate all PDFs and compress them using an online service.
    - Locate all PNG and JPG images and compress them using an online service.
    - Ensure that compressed files replace the originals or store them in a `Compressed/` subfolder.

    ### 3. Task Execution from `todo.txt`
    - Read the contents of `todo.txt` and execute tasks if they match the following patterns:
    1. **Email Reminders:**  
        - Identify lines containing: `Remind me to \"...\" via email`  
        - Extract the message and send an email reminder.  
    2. **Calendar Events:**  
        - Identify lines like: `Add a calendar invite for \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\" and share it with \"email@example.com\"`  
        - Create a calendar invite and send it to the specified email.  
    3. **Stock Price Notifications:**  
        - Identify: `Share the stock price for NVIDIA every day at 5 PM via email with me`  
        - Fetch NVIDIA's stock price at the scheduled time and email it.  
    4. **(Optional) Additional Task Handling:**  
        - Extend functionality if new types of tasks are detected in `todo.txt`.

    You must respond with a complete sequence of function calls needed to accomplish all tasks. Each step in the process should be a separate function call.

    For a complete workflow, you should:
    1. First organize files into appropriate folders
    2. Then compress any media files found
    3. Finally process any todo.txt tasks

    Example sequence of function calls:
    organize_files(source_file="document.pdf", destination_folder="PDFs/")
    organize_files(source_file="image.jpg", destination_folder="Images/")
    compress_pdf(file_path="PDFs/document.pdf")
    compress_image(file_path="Images/image.jpg")
    send_email(recipient="user@example.com", subject="Task Reminder", body="Don't forget to review the document")
    add_calendar_event(date="2025-02-15", time="14:00", attendees=["user@example.com"])
    send_daily_stock_update(symbol="NVDA", recipient="user@example.com")

    Available functions:
    - organize_files(source_file: str, destination_folder: str)
    - compress_image(file_path: str)
    - compress_pdf(file_path: str) 
    - send_email(recipient: str, subject: str, body: str)
    - add_calendar_event(date: str, time: str, attendees: list[str])
    - share_stock_market_data(symbol: str, interval: str)
    - send_daily_stock_update(symbol: str, recipient: str)

    Important:
    - Make ALL necessary function calls to complete the task
    - Ensure calls are in the correct sequential order
    - Each function call should be on a new line
    - Do not include any explanatory text or JSON formatting
    - Each function call must include all required parameters
